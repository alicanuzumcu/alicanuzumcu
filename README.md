## Introduction

I am an industrial engineer with a strong focus on data analytics and process optimization. I have worked on innovative projects that combine deep learning and computer vision techniques to enhance industrial automation. During my internship at EPIC ROBOTICS and for my graduation project, I developed solutions for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), enabling them to detect and dock with industrial pallets efficiently. My goal is to continuously grow in the field of data science and machine learning, driving data-driven decisions and automation in industrial environments.
